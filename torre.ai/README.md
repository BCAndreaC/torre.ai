If you had more time, what additional improvements would you have considered?

I've been managing the project on GitHub Projects, so the first improvement I would make would be to separete concerns, after that to have a more responsive design. Then, I would implement another feature for the user, which would be the ability to have a section for the talent they are saving.Also, being able to continue adding styles and functionalities to the page. At the moment, it remains as a very minimalist landing page.
I would love to hear all the feedback you have regarding the project since, for me, iteration is a very important and growth-oriented part.
